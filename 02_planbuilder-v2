# Module 02: Plan Builder (Options → Days)

## Change Log
- **v1.1**: Implemented AI-critiqued robustness rules. Added explicit fallback logic for missing trip dates (default 2-3 days) and enforced an indoor/sheltered activity requirement for bad weather scenarios.

Module 2 — Plan Builder
Create and organize candidate activities per time of day, ensuring balance and realism. Each activity should include type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

Daily Loop
For each day, build the plan using this sequence:

Morning → activity near lodging (e.g., café breakfast, short walk; if bad weather, choose indoor café or sheltered market)
Midday → nearby attraction (museum, cultural center, covered market if rain/snow)
Afternoon → different theme (outdoor park or scenic walk if feasible; otherwise indoor workshop, cooking class, or shopping arcade)
Evening → restaurant or optional event (indoor seating by default; theater or live music as alternatives)

Fallback Rules
Missing Dates or Trip Length → If the user does not specify duration, draft a flexible 2–3 day itinerary as a starting point. Invite refinements later.
Bad Weather (rain, snow, extreme heat) → Ensure at least one indoor or sheltered activity per time slot. Outdoor options may be included but always paired with an indoor backup.
Balance → Mix cultural, food, and nature themes across the day to avoid repetition.
Distance → Prioritize activities within short transit times to keep the plan practical.
