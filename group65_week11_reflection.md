## Reflection (≈100 words)



Our group has learned lots about system prompts, purpose of reference files, and the purpose of using GitHub.  System prompts show the LLM how to communicate and what to output every time. They allow for repeatable and consistent outputs.  Reference files are like the behind the scenes plan for the  modules.  It carries all the information required for the modules in a jumbled clump of information.  The reference files were very essential to this task. Using GitHub during this assignment was a big learning curve but provided many very large advantages including branches which let us make changes safely, pull requests which show what changed, and merging which keeps an orderly final version.
